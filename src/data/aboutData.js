  bio: [
    "Technical deployment and automation engineer working on solving real operational problems through code, cloud, and data workflows. I work with SQL, Metabase, and n8n to build meaningful internal tools and dashboards that enable better decision-making and streamline processes across enterprise clients.",

    "I enjoy building practical systems—whether it’s automation workflows that trigger operational reminders through Google Sheets and n8n, hosting applications on Azure VMs, or designing dashboards using SQL and Metabase on top of complex relational databases. I focus on solving real problems through code rather than building things for the sake of tutorials, and every project I work on originates from something I’ve personally needed to fix or improve.",

    "I’m currently exploring DevOps, cloud platforms, and automation tooling to understand how scalable systems are built and maintained, and how technology can eliminate repetitive work and improve real-world operations.",
